Hayling Island GHZ bands SDR project  

This is the UK Microwave Group's GHz Bands SDR project called “Hayling.” 
Named in memory of GHz bands pioneer Mike Walters G3JVL who’s QTH was Hayling Island, it’s a low-cost open source, Pluto SDR and Raspberry Pi based starter transceiver covering the low Microwave bands up to 5.7GHz. 
The design, led by Colin G4EML leverages on the successful Portsdown ATV transmitter code, and at the time of writing, (November 2019) an early prototype is running. 
At the moment this prototype Hayling works on SSB and CW from 70MHz to 6GHz producing just 1mW, and Colin is working on adding FM. Eventually It will be released on this UKuG GitHub site 
RF hardware will be added round it, again all open source and the group hopes kits will be made available in due course.
